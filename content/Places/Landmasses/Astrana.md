Astrana is a massive super-continent on [[Mir]], surrounded by ocean. The coastal and outer regions of Astrana are rich with a remarkable variety of life and environments, as well as home to many pockets of civilization. The massive landmassâ€™ interior, however, is an incomprehensibly vast desert that resists most attempts to establish civilization in the desert, with [[Meldirias|one major exception]]. 

The wide open ocean and lack of distributed landmass makes for an incomprehensibly powerful storm generator. These massive storms - mega-monsoons - batter the coasts of Astrana and make it difficult for cities to develop and flourish on the parts of coastline they arrive in.
