The world of Mir is mostly covered by ocean, polar ice caps, and [[Astrana]], a super-continent like Pangaea. Astrana is home to a remarkable diversity of life, climates, and [[People of Mir|people]], as a landmass stretching continuously nearly from one pole to the other. 

There are also a number of islands across the expansive ocean of Mir, but the open ocean is a dangerous place, as the lack of distributed landmass makes it something of a monsoon factory. These mega-monsoons batter the coasts of Astrana, and have thwarted many attempts at colonizing islands under their immense force.

*Mir is earth in an alternate reality. The super-continent Astrana is based on projections of how the earth will look due to tectonic plate movement in some 300 million years. Life developed differently on Mir, and sentient life forms are much more varied than the people of earth.*
